📌 Protocols in Networking

1️⃣ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)└─ Ensures that data reaches its destination completely, correctly, and in order.

2️⃣ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)└─ Sends data without guaranteeing full delivery; it's faster but less reliable.

3️⃣ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)└─ Defines the format of data transferred between web clients (browsers) and servers.

📌 How Data Moves in the Internet?

✔ Data moves in the form of chunks or packets.✔ Every device on the internet has a unique IP address.✔ To check your public IP, use:

irm http://ipconfig.me   # PowerShell  
curl -s http://ipconfig.me   # Linux/macOS  

📌 Network Structure

Internet Service Provider (Global IP Address)│└── Modem/Router├── D1 (Private IP1)├── D2 (Private IP2)└── D3 (Private IP3)

📌 How Devices Get IP Addresses?

✔ The modem/router uses DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)└─ Dynamically assigns IP addresses to connected devices in a network.

✔ The router uses NAT (Network Address Translation)└─ Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP by mapping private IPs.

📌 Understanding Port Numbers

✔ Port numbers determine which applications handle incoming/outgoing traffic.✔ Total possible port numbers: 2¹⁶ = 65,536

📌 Commonly Used Ports

HTTP → 80 (Web traffic)

HTTPS → 443 (Secure web traffic)

FTP → 21 (File Transfer Protocol)

SSH → 22 (Secure Shell)

DNS → 53 (Domain Name System)

MongoDB → 27017 (Database service)

📌 Port Ranges

0 - 1023 → Well-known (Reserved) Ports (Used by system services like HTTP, SSH, etc.)

1024 - 49,151 → Registered Ports (Assigned to software applications)

49,152 - 65,535 → Dynamic/Private Ports (Available for temporary use)
