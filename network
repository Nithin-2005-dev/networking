# 📌 Structure of a Network

## 🔹 Example: **Placing an Order on Amazon**

   📦 Order Placed            ✅ Order Received            (Application Layer)
   (User Interaction)         (Amazon's Server)

### **Layer Breakdown**
✔ **Application Layer** → Order is placed via the Amazon website.  
✔ **Presentation + Session Layer** → Amazon servers process and handle requests.  
✔ **Transport Layer** → Ensures order details are reliably transmitted.  
✔ **Network Layer** → Routes order information between locations.  
✔ **Data Link & Physical Layer** → The actual physical transmission of data occurs.  



📌 OSI Model

## 1️⃣ Application Layer  
- **Implemented in software.**  
- Provides **network services directly to user applications** (e.g., web browsing, file transfer).  
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

## 2️⃣ Presentation Layer  
- **Data encryption, compression, and abstraction.**  
- Ensures data is in a readable format for the **Application Layer**.  
- Examples: SSL, TLS, JPEG, MPEG.

## 3️⃣ Session Layer  
- **Sets up, manages, and terminates connections.**  
- Ensures data transfer by establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions.  
- Examples: NetBIOS, RPC.

## 4️⃣ Transport Layer  
- **Responsible for reliable data transfer.**  
- Manages **flow control, error detection, and correction**.  
- Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable).

## 5️⃣ Network Layer  
- **Handles data routing, forwarding, and addressing.**  
- Breaks down messages into **packets** and ensures they reach their destination.  
- Protocols: IP, ICMP, RIP, OSPF.

## 6️⃣ Data Link Layer  
- **Provides node-to-node data transfer.**  
- Handles **error detection and correction** within the physical network.  
- Protocols: Ethernet, PPP, ARP.

## 7️⃣ Physical Layer  
- **Transmits raw bits over a physical medium.**  
- Deals with **hardware components** like cables, switches, and radio signals.
