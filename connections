# 📌 Mobile Network Generations

### 1️⃣ 3G (Third Generation)
✔ Introduced higher data speeds (up to a few Mbps).  
✔ Enabled **mobile internet, video calls, and basic streaming**.  
✔ Used technologies like **UMTS, HSPA, and CDMA2000**.  

### 2️⃣ 4G (Fourth Generation)
✔ Significantly faster (up to **1 Gbps** in ideal conditions).  
✔ Supports **HD video streaming, online gaming, and VoLTE (Voice over LTE)**.  
✔ Uses technologies like **LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and WiMAX**.  

# 📌 Network Basics  

## 🌐 Network Types  

✔ **LAN (Local Area Network)** → Small house/office  
✔ **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** → Across a city  
✔ **WAN (Wide Area Network)** → Across countries  
   - **SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)**  
   - **Frame Relay**

# 📌 Network Topologies  

## 1️⃣ **Bus Topology**  
✔ All devices connected to a **single central cable**.  

[Device1]----[Device2]----[Device3]----[Device4]


2️⃣ Ring Topology
✔ Devices connected in a circular structure.
       [Device1] ---- [Device2]
          |              |
       [Device4] ---- [Device3]

3️⃣ Star Topology
✔ Devices connected to a central hub/switch.

          [Device1]  
             |  
[Device2] -- [Hub] -- [Device3]  
             |  
          [Device4]  

4️⃣ Tree Topology (Bus + Star)
✔ Hierarchical structure combining Bus & Star topologies.

          [Root Hub]  
          /    |    \  
      [Hub1] [Hub2] [Hub3]  
      /   \     |      |  
 [D1]   [D2]  [D3]   [D4]  

5️⃣ Mesh Topology
✔ Every device connects to every other device.

       [D1] ----- [D2]
        |  \      /  |
        |   \    /   |
       [D3] ----- [D4]
