->in transport layer the data is in segments
->in network layer the data travels in the form of packets
->in data link layer has frames

Here we work with routers:-

control plane:-
->used to build these routing tables.
1)static routing
->adding address manually
2)dynamic routing

internet protocol:-
->ipv4-32 bit numbers with 4 words
->ipv6-128 bits with 8 words

🌑 Classes of IP Addresses (IPv4)

| Class | Starting Range     | Ending Range         | Default Subnet Mask | Usage                               |
|-------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| A     | 0.0.0.0            | 127.255.255.255      | 255.0.0.0           | Large networks (e.g., ISPs, big companies) |
| B     | 128.0.0.0          | 191.255.255.255      | 255.255.0.0         | Medium-sized networks (e.g., universities, organizations) |
| C     | 192.0.0.0          | 223.255.255.255      | 255.255.255.0       | Small networks (e.g., private businesses) |
| D     | 224.0.0.0          | 239.255.255.255      | N/A                 | Multicasting (not for regular hosts) |
| E     | 240.0.0.0          | 255.255.255.255      | N/A                 | Reserved for experimental purposes |


🌑 Special Address Ranges:

- Private Addresses:
  - Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255  
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255  
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255  

- Loopback Address:
  - 127.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 (Usually 127.0.0.1 for testing within the host computer)

packets:header is of 20 bytes
